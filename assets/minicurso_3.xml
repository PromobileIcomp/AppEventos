    <resume>Resumo: The transmission of multimedia content will represent up to 90% of all Internet traffic in a few years, where it will be mainly accessed over wireless networks. However, this new wireless multimedia era requires instantaneous adaptation of multimedia content and the network resources according to user’s preferences, experiences, or interests. In this context, human-centric multimedia networking (HCMN) appears as a promising model for next generation of wireless multimedia networks. In such scenarios, users will produce, share, and consume video flows ubiquitously, ranging from entertaining to real-time video flows about natural disasters or surveillance. Although, optimizations in HCMN scenarios must consider issues related to the network, the video characteristics, and, especially, human’s preferences or the human’s visual system. In this way, HCMN systems place the human’s experience in the centre of mobile video services, protocols, and applications, where the video transmission process must be done and optimized in real-time according to the human’s perceptions, content’s characteristics, and also context-awareness. In this work, we introduce the basic concepts for the video transmission in HCMN systems. We also detail main existing mechanisms, which aim to improve the performance of HCMN system in sharing video content, including Quality of Experience (QoE)-based solutions for handover, routing, error correction, decisionmaking, and controlling the dissemination of video flows in wireless multimedia-aware environments.</resume>
