    <resume>Resumo: The aim of green cloud computing is to achieve a balance between resource consumption and quality of service. This work introduces the distributed system management model, analyses the systemâ€™s behavior, describes the operation principles, and presents case study scenarios and some results. We extended CloudSim to simulate the organization model approach and implemented the migration and reallocation policies using this improved version to validate our management solution. In this context, we proposed strategies to optimize the use of the cloud computing resources, introducing two hybrid strategies, describing the base strategies, validating and analyzing them, and presenting the results. The basic principles pointed out in recent works for power management in legacy network equipment are presented, and a model for its use to optimize green cloud approach is proposed.</resume>
